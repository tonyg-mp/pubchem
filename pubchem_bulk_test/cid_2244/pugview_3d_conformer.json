This structure may or may not be the same as the inherent structure of the compound you would expect to see in vacuum or in the gas phase, because the underlying computational algorithm aims to generate a protein-bound structure, which would be observed in a protein-ligand complex.  More detailed information on this conformer model can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",
